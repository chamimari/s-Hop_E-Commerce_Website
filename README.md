# s-Hop_E-Commerce_Website
An E-Commerce website group project from a Web Design class, created with only HTML and CSS.

s-Hop is an e-commerce website which provides online shopping experience, offering a wide range of products from daily essentials, books, electronics gadgets, and fashion. s-Hop features category-specific product pages, a shopping cart, customer service support, promotion and flash deal pages, delivery status tracking, and a wishlist. Users can manage their profiles by adjusting the settings and make secure payments. The search tools help users to find desired products quickly and efficiently.

Project is created by me and three other members, whose names I shall not disclose for privacy reasons.
